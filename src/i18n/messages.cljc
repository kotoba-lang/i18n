  "Compile-time message accessors — the paraglide-js equivalent for cljc.

  paraglide compiles each key in the source-locale message file into a
  tree-shakeable, type-checked JS function (`m.appTitle()`). `defmessages`
  does the same thing at the Clojure/ClojureScript compiler level: it reads
  an EDN catalog resource ONCE, at macroexpansion time (which runs on the
  JVM for both clj and cljs compilation, so this works identically for both
  targets), and emits one plain `defn` per message key. The generated `defn`
  is a normal var — unused ones are dropped by ClojureScript's
  :advanced-mode dead-code elimination exactly like unused paraglide message
  functions are dropped by esbuild/Rollup tree-shaking.

  Unlike paraglide, the generated functions do NOT bake in the string —
  they call `i18n.core/t` with the key, so `set-locale!` at runtime still
  switches what they render. What's fixed at compile time is only the *set
  of keys* (an unknown key is a compile error, giving the same typo-safety
  paraglide's generated functions give), not the translated text itself."
